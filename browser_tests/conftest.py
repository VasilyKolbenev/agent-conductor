"""One browser for the whole browser gate.

Each module used to enter its own ``sync_playwright``, so whether the gate
passed depended on the order its files were collected in: a second context
manager entered while a session-scoped one is still open raises "Playwright
Sync API inside the asyncio loop", and the same suite therefore passed named
one way and errored named the other. One session-scoped fixture, here, takes
the ordering out of the answer.

This file holds that fixture and nothing else.
